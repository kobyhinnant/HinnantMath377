    "Last lesson, we studied method of moments estimators. These estimators are obtained by setting the moments of a distribution equal to the sample moments obtained from an independent random sample, and then solving for the parameters of interest. As we saw, method of moments estimators are relatively easy to find, but don't always make sense (as in the case of $X\\sim \\textsf{Unif}(0,b)$.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to estimate is by maximizing the likelihood function. First, we should introduce the likelihood function. The likelihood function, $L(\\theta \\mid \\textbf{x})$, is a function of $\\theta$ that is larger for likelier values of $\\theta$. Finding the value of $\\theta$ that maximizes this function yields a maximum likelihood estimator, or $\\hat{\\theta}_{ML}$. \n",
